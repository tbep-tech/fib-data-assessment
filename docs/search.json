The latest download was performed 1/29/2024 and this is the link to the query.\nThat download was pre-processed using R/WQP_preprocessing.R to:\n\nfilter out Groundwater samples - only keeping Surface Water.\n\nonly keep sample types Fecal Coliform, Total Coliform, Enterococcus, and E. coli (eliminates DNA-based samples). Total Coliform is in the processed data frame but I am ignoring it in this exploration.\n\nonly keep a small subset of columns relevant to this exploration.\n\nThe pre-processing reduced the file size from 167MB to 40MB, and the smaller file is used in this document."
